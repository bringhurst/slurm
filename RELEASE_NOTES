RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.5
7 August 2012


IMPORTANT NOTE:
If using the slurmdbd (SLURM DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.
The 2.5 slurmdbd will work with SLURM daemons of version 2.3 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other
until you do.  Also at least the first time running the slurmdbd you need to
make sure your my.cnf file has innodb_buffer_pool_size equal to at least 64M.
You can accomplish this by adding the line

innodb_buffer_pool_size=64M

under the [mysqld] reference in the my.cnf file and restarting the mysqld.
This is needed when converting large tables over to the new database schema.

SLURM can be upgraded from version 2.3 or 2.4 to version 2.5 without loss of
jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version of
SLURM will result in loss of state information.


HIGHLIGHTS
==========
- Major performance improvements for high-throughput computing.
- Added support for IBM Parallel Environment (PE) including the launching of
  jobs using either the srun or poe command.
- Add support for advanced reservation for specific cores rather than whole
  nodes.
- Added srun option "--cpu-freq" to enable user control over the job's CPU
  frequency and thus it's power consumption.
- Added priority/multifactor2 plugin supporting ticket based shares.
- Added gres/mic plugin supporting Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors. 

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see "man slurm.conf" for details)
=============================================================
- Added DebugFlag option of "Switch" to log switch plugin details.
- When running with multiple slurmd daemons per node, enable specifying a
  range of ports on a single line of the node configuration in slurm.conf.
- New SelectType plugin of "serial" provides highly optimized throughput for
  serial (single CPU) jobs.
- New SwitchType plugin of "nrt" provides support for IBM Network Resource
  Table API.
- Added configuration option of "LaunchType" to control the mechanism used for
  launching application tasks. Available plugins include "slurm" (native SLURM
  mode), "runjob" (for use with IBM BlueGene/Q systems) and "poe" (for use with
  IBM Parallel Environment).

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
===========================================
- Added sinfo option of "-T" to print reservation information.
- Added LicensesUsed field to output of "scontrol show configuration" command.
  Output is of the form "name:used/total".
- Add reservation flag of "Part_Nodes" to allocate all nodes in a partition to
  a reservation and automatically change the reservation when nodes are
  added to or removed from the reservation.
- sinfo partition field size will be set the the length of the longest
  partition name by default.

OTHER CHANGES
=============


API CHANGES
===========


Changed members of the following structs
========================================
slurm_step_launch_callbacks_t - added step_signal for signaling steps that
				are perhaps not running as srun.
Added cpu_load to node_info.


Added the following struct definitions
======================================


Changed the following enums and #defines
========================================


Added the following API's
=========================
slurm_step_launch_add - added for adding tasks to steps that were
		       	previously started.  (Note: it currently has only been
			tested with user managed io jobs.)

Changed the following API's
===========================
slurm_step_ctx_daemon_per_node_hack - ported to newer poe interface
